![XIVIX Robot](./assets/xivix-robot.png)

## Overview

The **XIVIX Robot** is an advanced physical activity monitoring system developed by XIVIX. This robot leverages AI-powered pose estimation to detect physical activities such as push-ups, squats, and other exercises, providing real-time rep counting and posture feedback to users.

## Project Vision

The XIVIX Robot aims to revolutionize fitness training and rehabilitation by providing autonomous, real-time physical activity analysis. By combining robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, this project creates an intelligent fitness companion capable of monitoring, analyzing, and guiding users through their exercise routines with precision and accuracy.

## Features

- **Activity Detection**: Identifies various physical exercises using computer vision and pose estimation
- **Rep Counting**: Automatically counts repetitions for detected exercises
- **Posture Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on exercise form and posture
- **Multi-modal Sensor Integration**: Combines visual data with additional sensor inputs for comprehensive monitoring
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses deep learning models for accurate pose and activity recognition
- **Simulation Environment**: Full robot simulation in Webots for testing and development
